2. Use of HTML:
HTML, the backbone of web content structuring, was chosen to define the webpage's elements. Its semantic nature ensures clarity and accessibility, both for developers and browsers.

3. Utilization of CSS for Styling:
CSS was employed to style HTML elements, covering layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness. Flexbox and media queries played a key role in crafting a design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

4.  Background Image:
To enhance the visual appeal, a background image was added using the background-image property in CSS. The image covers the entire screen and remains fixed as users scroll.

Media queries were crucial for making the webpage responsive across devices. Tailoring styles based on screen width ensures an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Adjustments were made to font sizes, margins, and widths for readability and layout.

6.  JavaScript:
JavaScript was included to handle dynamic interactions on the webpage. Although specific functionalities weren't detailed, JavaScript can dynamically update the total price based on user selections and manage other client-sideÂ interactions.
